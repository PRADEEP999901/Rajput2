🕵️ Help:

FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CHANNEL OR GROUP:
- First, log in.
- Then send the message link of any channel that you've joined in your login account.

FOR BOT:
- Send the link in this format: https://t.me/b/bot_username/message_id (use Plus Messenger for message_id)

FOR GROUP TOPIC:
- (For Private Group) Group topic link is like: https://t.me/c/xxxxxxxxx/first_id/second_id
But, send it like this: https://t.me/c/xxxxxxx/second_id (remove first id and one /)
- (For Public Group) Follow the private link step but remove "/c" from the link. Ex - https://t.me/username/second_id

#FAQ:

- If the bot says "Have you joined the channel?" then just log in again to the bot and try.

- If your batch is stuck, then use /stop.
